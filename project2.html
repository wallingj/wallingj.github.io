		<div class="header prob">The Problem</div>
		Given an inputted treasure map, output the optimal route to take to get to the treasure. <br><br>
		The inputted map takes the form of a grid, where each grid element is either water, land, impassable terrain, the starting location, or the treasure location.
		<div class="grid-images">
		  <div class="grid-item-treasure badt"></div>
		  <div class="grid-item-treasure goodt"></div>
		</div>
		Since the program needs to output the optimal route, the pirate crew must explore the map in such a way that once the treasure is found, they can "re-trace" their steps to reveal the optimal path. <br><br>
		<div class="header sol">The Solution</div>
		My program utilized two data structures (forms of data storage in programming) called stacks and queues in order to search the grid. <br><br>
		While I searched the grid, I kept track of where I came from in order to output the optimal path when the crew found the treasure.
